"Lemon tree" is my favorite song, and I like it very much. Today, I introduce it to you and hope you will like it too.
"Lemon Tree" is a song by German band Fool's Garden from the album Dish of the Day, which was released as a single in 1995 and became a major international hit in 1996. The single reached number 26 in the UK charts and remained at number one for several weeks in Germany. It also reached number one in Ireland and later Dustin the Turkey recorded a Christmas-parody called "Christmas Tree".
